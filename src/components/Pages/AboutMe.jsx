              Hello, iâ€™m Munimul! During my 1 year of experience as a Junior
              Mern Stack Developer, I have learned a wide variety of Front-end
              technologies, including HTML, CSS, Javascript, and a few popular
              frameworks, such as Bootstrap, Tailwind CSS, and React.js, as well
              as some back-end technologies, such as Node.js, express.js, and
              MongoDB. I finished some full-stack projects that I include on my
              resume. Also, I have experience in responsive web design and
              single-page applications. I excel at teamwork and communication
              skills.
